    Ocaml.  The Collatz conjectures states that for any positive inte-
   ger $n$, if it is repeatedly replaced by $ n / 2 $ when even and $
   3 n + 1 $ when odd, it eventually converges on the integer $1$.
   Write a function that uses a tail-recursive inner function to re-
   turn a list of all integers starting from the argument and ending
   with 1.  The inner function produces the list in the reverse order,
   then the outer function reverses the list.  Use List.rev from the
   library to reverse the list.  [4pt]

   Without using a higher-order function, and being sure to use tail
   recursion where required, define the function max which takes an
   inequality operator and a list and returns its maximum value.  In
   each case return a special value (see below) for an empty list and
   use an inner worker function otherwise.  See examples.

   (a) Scheme.  Return #f for an empty list.  [3pt]
